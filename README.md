# Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS) for Human-Pose-Forecasting
This repository contains an implementation of the paper [Learning to Simulate Complex Physics with Graph Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09405) to perform Human Pose Forecasting.

## Create Environment

```console
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
